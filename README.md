- `get_price()`: Returns the sales price of the species.
- `__str__()`: Returns the name of the fish species.

### Hatchery
The `Hatchery` class is the main class that manages the operations of the hatchery. It tracks cash, technicians, fish species, supplies, and vendors. It simulates the fish sales process, inventory management, and financial calculations.

**Attributes:**
- `cash`: The hatchery's current cash balance.
- `technicians`: List of technicians at the hatchery.
- `species`: List of fish species available for sale.
- `supplies`: List of supplies such as fertilizer, feed, and salt.
- `vendors`: List of vendors providing materials for the hatchery.
- `total_revenue`: Total revenue from fish sales.
- `total_expense`: Total cost of purchased materials.
- `total_expenses`: Total expenses including technician wages, rent/utilities, supply costs, etc.
- `total_warehouse_cost`: Cost of warehouse maintenance.

**Methods:**
- `set_cash(amount)`: Sets the hatchery's cash balance.
- `add_supply(supply)`: Adds a supply to the hatchery's inventory.
- `update_supplies()`: Updates the supply inventory, considering depreciation.
- `add_technician(name, weekly_rate, specialty=None)`: Adds a technician to the hatchery.
- `sell_fish()`: Simulates fish sales and updates finances based on available labor and materials.
- `calculate_and_print_expenses()`: Calculates and prints the quarterly expenses.
- `calculate_cash_after_expenses()`: Calculates remaining cash after all expenses are deducted.

## Usage

To run the simulation program, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the hatchery**: Create a new `Hatchery` instance and set an initial cash balance.
2. **Add technicians**: Use the `add_technician()` method to hire technicians.
3. **Add fish species**: Create `FishSpecies` instances and add them to the hatchery's fish species list.
4. **Add supplies**: Create `Supply` instances (e.g., fertilizer, feed, salt) and add them to the hatchery's inventory.
5. **Add vendors**: Create `Vendor` instances and add them to the hatchery's vendor list.
6. **Run the simulation**: Use methods such as `sell_fish()` and `calculate_and_print_expenses()` to simulate a quarter's operations.

# Data Analytics

This project provides an analysis of datasets fetched from Kaggle, including their views, upvotes, and other attributes. The data is processed, visualized, and analyzed for correlations and linear relationships.

## Project Structure

1. **Kaggle API Integration**: 
   - The code fetches datasets from Kaggle using the Kaggle API, retrieves details such as views, upvotes, and other metadata, and stores this information into a DataFrame.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - The project retrieves a list of datasets using the Kaggle API and stores information like dataset name, ID, description, tags, views, upvotes, file size, upload time, author, license, and file types.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The data is cleaned by removing irrelevant or empty fields. Datasets are limited to the top 200 based on the number of upvotes.

4. **Popularity Score**:
   - A new column, `popularity_score`, is created using a weighted combination of views (60%) and upvotes (40%). This score is then used for further analysis.

5. **Data Exploration**:
   - **Statistical Summary**: The summary statistics of the datasets are displayed.
   - **Visualization**: 
     - A histogram showing the distribution of views.
     - A scatter plot of views vs upvotes.
     - A linear regression analysis between dataset age (ID) and views/upvotes.
     - Correlation between views and upvotes.
     - A visualization showing the relationship between dataset age and views/upvotes.

6. **Linear Regression Analysis**:
   - Linear regression is used to model the relationship between dataset age (represented by ID) and both views and upvotes.

7. **Output**:
   - The results are saved into a CSV file (`top_200_datasets_info_with_scores.csv`) containing the dataset information and popularity scores.
   - The results of the linear regression models, including coefficients and intercepts, are printed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `kaggle` (for Kaggle API access)

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn kaggle
```

## Setup

1. **Kaggle API Setup**:
   - You must have a Kaggle account and generate your API credentials.
   - Set the environment variables for your Kaggle username and key:

   ```python
   os.environ['KAGGLE_USERNAME'] = 'your_kaggle_username'
   os.environ['KAGGLE_KEY'] = 'your_kaggle_key'
   ```

2. **Running the Script**:
   - Once you've set up the Kaggle API credentials, you can run the script to fetch and analyze the datasets.
   - The script will retrieve datasets, process the data, perform analysis, and generate visualizations.

## Steps in the Code

### 1. Kaggle API Authentication

The script starts by authenticating with Kaggle using your API credentials.

### 2. Fetching Dataset Information

The script uses Kaggleâ€™s API to fetch datasets, starting from the most upvoted ones, and stores various metadata for each dataset.

### 3. Data Preprocessing and Filtering

The datasets are cleaned, removing irrelevant fields. The top 200 datasets are selected based on the upvote count.

### 4. Popularity Score Calculation

A weighted popularity score is calculated based on the views and upvotes of each dataset.

### 5. Data Exploration

- Statistical summaries and visualizations are provided, such as distributions of views and upvotes.
- Scatter plots and linear regression are used to analyze the relationship between views, upvotes, and dataset age (represented by ID).

### 6. Output

The script saves the dataset information, including the popularity score, to a CSV file and prints the results of the regression models.

---

## Example Output

- **CSV File**: The resulting dataset information, including popularity scores, is saved to `top_200_datasets_info_with_scores.csv`.
- **Printed Results**: The regression model coefficients and intercepts, as well as the correlation between views and upvotes, are printed in the console.
